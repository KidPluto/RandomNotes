Need to add a page for Git Bash

* This is a good reference for key board comamnds https://gist.github.com/tuxfight3r/60051ac67c5f0445efee
* Also I can document my .bash_profile
* Copy is `control - insert`
* Paste is `shift - insert`
* Warning - when you try and use a Windows formatted path it might drop the slashes.  So `C:\Usr\Me` might become `c:usrme`  Also when using double quotes insert them on the command line instead of trying to cut and paste from another location - as those might not be the correct double quotes.
* See if some thing like this in .bash_profile resizes the terminal
```
#!/bin/bash
resize -s 33 100
stty rows 33
stty cols 100
```
